The book of Nehemiah in the Bible is believed to be written by Nehemiah himself or by Ezra, another Jewish leader. The book is a first-person account of the events from the perspective of Nehemiah. It describes how Nehemiah was burdened by the fact that the walls of Jerusalem were still in shambles and how he prayed for the rebuilding of the walls of his beloved city. Nehemiah worked as the cupbearer to the Persian king Artexerxes. After Nehemiah's great grief could no longer be hidden, the king inquired as to what troubled his servant. Nehemiah responded that his beloved city was destroyed and in ruins. He asked permission to go and help build the city. Not only did the king give him permission, but the king also gave him the resources he would need to accomplish the task. Nehemiah returned to Jerusalem and supervised the rebuilding of the city walls. The book of Nehemiah is a great story of the rebuilding of Jerusalem and serves as an example to us that we need to be constantly reminded of God's Word", "Wall-crawling"],
